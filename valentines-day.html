            <h2>Our Love Journey</h2>
            <p><em>From two friends to this special Valentine‚Äôs Day, our journey has been nothing short of magical. Here‚Äôs how we went from friends to something so much more... ‚ù§Ô∏è</em></p>
            <p><strong>2018</strong> ‚Äì We met for the first time, just two school kids playing together. Our friendship grew, and I started to think you were the cutest person ever.</p>
            <p><strong>2021</strong> ‚Äì I became your teacher, helping you study for exams. In those moments, I fell for you, and we shared a short-lived relationship, played badminton and had a cute thing between us.</p>
            <p><strong>2022-2023</strong> ‚Äì Life took us on different paths. During COVID, we drifted apart, though we never completely stopped talking.</p>
            <p><strong>2023</strong> ‚Äì I prepared to leave for the US, still deeply in love with you. Before I left, we met in a garden, and as I held your hands and looked into your eyes, I fell in love with you all over again.</p>
            <p><strong>2024 (Summer)</strong> ‚Äì I returned to India, hoping for a second chance, but you told me we couldn‚Äôt be together. Still, we went to your favorite spot‚Äîthe lake. I held your hands, stood close, and let my heart speak even when words failed.</p>
            <p><strong>January 2025</strong> ‚Äì I came back, determined never to lose you again. We went on dates, shared beautiful moments, and I saw you in that gorgeous purple outfit, looking more breathtaking than ever. I hugged you countless times, took many pictures, and fell even harder for you.</p>
            <p><strong>February 11, 2025</strong> ‚Äì You asked me to be your Valentine. My heart melted. I know I‚Äôll keep trying until the day you finally say yes to being my girlfriend.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="love-letter">
            <h2>A Letter from My Heart üíå</h2>
            <button onclick="document.getElementById('letter-content').classList.toggle('hidden')">Unseal My Heart üíñ</button>
            <p id="letter-content" class="hidden">Babe,<br><br>
                Finally, I get to have my first Valentine‚Äôs Day with you! It still feels unbelievable‚ÄîI can‚Äôt believe that you are actually my Valentine. I am so lucky to have you, sweetheart. You are the most special girl in my life. You know exactly how to brighten even my gloomiest days. Your eyes‚Äîso beautiful, so expressive‚Äîspeak volumes even when we aren‚Äôt talking.<br><br>
                Every time I reflect on our journey, I realize how much you‚Äôve helped me grow into a better person. Before you, love was just a word to me‚ÄîI never truly understood it or cared for it. But meeting you changed everything. I learned what it means to care for someone deeply, to support them unconditionally, and to love them through every situation. You are one of my biggest motivations to keep going and giving my best.<br><br>
                I‚Äôll keep this love letter short, but my feelings for you are anything but small. I hope one day, just like this valentines, we will be in a relationship and I‚Äôll be able to call you mine in front of whole world, lift you, hug you and kiss you without any worries. Until that day comes, I just want to thank you for being the incredible person you are. <br><br>
                I love you, Druberry! ‚ù§Ô∏è
